This site has always been about discovery: a clean way to browse curated repositories without getting lost in tabs.

The blog adds a second layer.

Instead of only listing projects, we can also explain *why* a category exists, how a list is evaluated before it’s added, and what changes when a topic shifts.

You can expect posts like:

- category rationale and scope notes
- curation standards and submission guidance
- periodic “what’s new” roundups
- deeper writeups on themes (AI infrastructure, sustainability, digital rights, and more)

If you follow the site regularly, this should make it easier to spot what changed and why it matters.
